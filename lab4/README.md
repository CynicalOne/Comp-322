# Comp-322

First Commit 4-21-2020
	This project is based off of the dining philosopher's problem. i initially wanted to start this lab before doing lab 3 but i was quickly bottlenecked when i needed information about signals. The code in this commit is very incomplete and only includes what i could do based on the project specs and what was said in the slack channel
	
	Project Status: Part 1 is still in progress
